- project: WooCommerce Subscriptions Limited Recurring Coupons
  role: Developer

    [Limited payment coupons](https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/subscriptions/limited-payment-coupon-guide/)
    allow store managers to create coupons that apply to a certain number of subscription payments.

    Limited coupons are coupons that will apply a discount for a limited number of payments. For example,
    if a store manager wants only the first three months of a monthly subscription to be discounted,
    they could use this feature to create a coupon that applies to three payments.

- project: Yikes, Inc Easy Mailchimp Extender V3 API

    A WordPress plugin that allows you to easily add MailChimp sign up forms to your site.

    I was brought on as a consultant to update the codebase to utilize version 3 of
    [MailChimp's API](https://developer.mailchimp.com). All of the details of this effort
    are [available on GitHub](https://github.com/yikesinc/yikes-inc-easy-mailchimp-extender/issues/462).

- project: WP CLI for WP Engine
  role: Developer
  duration: false
  description: |
    Created a custom package of [WP CLI](http://wp-cli.org) that is able to run in the
    WP Engine environment. I also set up security for WP CLI to ensure that individual clients
    can access their own sites but not the sites of neighbors.

    The custom packaging of WP CLI involved reengineering the WP CLI build process to build a
    custom PHAR that could switch to the necessary AppArmor profile for customer sites.

- project: Multisite Conversion script
  role: Developer
  duration: false
  description: |
    Converting a WordPress site to Multisite required many steps on the WP Engine platform. I developed
    a CLI utility that would automate all of the steps and free up significant time for WP Engine
    support specialists.
