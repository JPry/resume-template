- project: Yikes, Inc Easy Mailchimp Extender V3 API
  role: Consultant
  duration: false
  description: |
    A WordPress plugin that allows you to easily add MailChimp sign up forms to your site.

    I was brought on as a consultant to update the codebase to utilize version 3 of
    [MailChimp's API](https://developer.mailchimp.com).

- project: WP CLI for WP Engine
  role: Developer
  duration: false
  description: |
    Created a custom package of [WP CLI](http://wp-cli.org) that is able to run in the
    WP Engine environment. I also set up security for WP CLI to ensure that individual clients
    can access their own sites but not the sites of neighbors.

    The custom packaging of WP CLI involved reengineering the WP CLI build process to build a
    custom PHAR that could switch to the necessary AppArmor profile for customer sites.

- project: Multisite Conversion script
  role: Developer
  duration: false
  description: |
    Converting a WordPress site to Multisite required many steps on the WP Engine platform. I developed
    a CLI utility that would automate all of the steps and free up significant time for WP Engine
    support specialists.
